ETL Outline:
Airbnb listings and Zillow home value datasets by Chicago neighborhood. Postgres and Pandas will be utilized for the ETL process.  


Extract 
Dataset used:
•	“listings”: Airbnb Listings   | Source: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html | Format: CSV. 
•	“neighborhood”: Zillow Home Values Index | Source: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ | Format: CSV 

Transform 
Most of the transformation needed to be done on the neighborhood dataset, in order to obtain the average price per neighborhood:
•	Filter by State (IL) and County (Cook) to align to listings.csv
•	Filter by year and select only 2019-2020 (available: 1996-2020) to align dates to listings.csv
•	Create a AvgPrice column to store the average price per neighborhood

We finally merged the two datasets on “neighborhood”, in order to add the average price and the price/year columns to the listings.csv


Load
•	The Airbnb database was created using pgAdmin
•	To create the tables, a DB Diagram was created using the Quick Database Diagrams app (https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/xOvKdU). Three tables were created:
o	Listings: store data from listings.csv
o	Neighborhood: store data from neighborhood.csv
o	Listings_neighborhood: store data from merged df
•	DataFrames were loaded into the database using jyputer notebook (“df.to_sql” function)


Challenges
•	We had to be generous with the VARCHAR in the listings table because names of the listings often contain description of the listings themselves. 
•	Filtering of the data was complicated by the different date format (European vs American)

If we had more time….
•	We would have spent a bit more time to find a way to retrieve neighborhood names from latitude and longitude coordinates, thus allowing us to use other datasets, like the “crime.csv” dataset found on the CPD website.
•	We would have run some analyses, like: 
o	Cost of listing vs house prices
o	trend of pricing over time
o	trend of Airbnb pricing over time
